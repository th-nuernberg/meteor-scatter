# Meteor Burst Detection and Classification Project

This project comprises two main Python scripts that work together to detect and classify meteor bursts from audio
spectrograms.

Please see also [documentation](Dokumentation_Meteor_Detection.docx).

## Installation and Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `pyaudio`, `wave`,
  `twitchrealtimehandler`, `pandas`. (pls see below)

### Setup

Install the required libraries:

```
(Change dir to this subfolder)
python -m venv venv_ms_detclass
source venv_ms_detclass/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-pi.txt
```

### Usage

Edit config in `prime_detection.py` as needed:

```
C_FILE_PATH_OUT = "/home/meteor/Desktop/testMSOUT/"  # TODO CSV OUT PATH

C_MS_SPEC_CUT_FACTOR = 8  # TODO Noise Filter

C_MS_CLUSTER_MIN_SAMPLES = 5  # TODO Cluster Filter
C_MS_CLUSTER_EPSILON = 30  # TODO Cluster Filter
```

Activate your new virtual environment and run:

```
(Change dir to this subfolder)
source venv_ms_detclass/bin/activate
python prime_detection.py
```

### Output

- Hourly and daily burst counts logged to CSV files.

## Overview

1. **prime_detection.py**
    - Captures audio in 30-second segments using the TwitchRealtimeHandler.
    - Creates spectrograms with the `plot_spectrogram` function.
    - Processes the spectrograms to detect and classify meteor bursts.

2. **detector_and_classification.py**
    - Contains the `detect_and_cluster_bursts` function.
    - Uses ORB feature detection and DBSCAN clustering to identify meteor bursts.
    - Classifies bursts into:
        - **Critical bursts**: Bursts lasting at least 0.5 seconds.
        - **Non-critical bursts**: Bursts lasting less than 0.5 seconds.

## prime_detection.py

### Key Features

- **Audio Recording**: Captures live audio streams from a Twitch source.
- **Spectrogram Generation**: Converts audio data into spectrogram images for processing.
- **CSV Logging**: Logs results, including the count of critical and non-critical bursts, to a daily CSV file.

### Workflow

1. **Audio Capture**:
    - Records 30-second audio segments from a specified Twitch stream.
    - Saves the audio as a WAV file.

2. **Spectrogram Generation**:
    - Plots and saves a spectrogram image from the recorded audio.
    - Dynamically adjusts the noise threshold based on spectrogram analysis.

3. **Burst Detection**:
    - Calls `detect_and_cluster_bursts` from `detector_and_classification.py`.
    - Updates hourly and daily burst counts.

4. **Daily CSV Logging**:
    - Records timestamped results to a CSV file.
    - Creates a new CSV file each day.

## detector_and_classification.py

### Key Features

- **ORB Detection**:
    - Uses the ORB algorithm to detect keypoints in the spectrogram image.
- **DBSCAN Clustering**:
    - Groups keypoints into clusters.
    - Labels clusters as bursts.

- **Burst Classification**:
    - Measures the duration of each burst.
    - Classifies bursts based on a duration threshold of 0.5 seconds.

### Workflow

1. **Feature Detection**:
    - Reads a spectrogram image.
    - Detects keypoints using the ORB algorithm.

2. **Clustering**:
    - Applies DBSCAN clustering to group keypoints.
    - Visualizes clusters with bounding boxes (green for critical, red for non-critical).

3. **Classification**:
    - Classifies bursts based on their duration.
    - Returns lists of critical and non-critical bursts.

### Output

- Annotated spectrogram image with detected bursts.
- Lists of critical and non-critical bursts.

## Future Work

- Optimize ORB and DBSCAN parameters for better burst detection.
- Integrate real-time burst visualization.
